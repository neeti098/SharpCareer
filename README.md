In this project, we aim to enhance the personalization of marketing strategies in an e-commerce setting by developing a recommendation system and building an API to serve these recommendations. We start by loading and preprocessing the purchase data, normalizing the 'Review Rating' and 'Purchase Amount (USD)' columns. Using the Surprise library, we create and train an SVD-based collaborative filtering model on our dataset, and we save this trained model for later use. Additionally, we prepare content-based recommendations by calculating the cosine similarity of product features, which include category, size, color, season, and review rating.

Next, we define functions to generate content-based, collaborative filtering, and hybrid recommendations, combining the strengths of both methods. We then set up a Flask web application to serve these recommendations through an API. This Flask app has endpoints to provide recommendations based on user ID and the purchased item, leveraging the pre-trained model and cosine similarity matrix. To run the Flask app in a cloud environment like Google Colab, we use ngrok to expose the local server to the internet, making it accessible for testing and integration.

By following these steps, we create a robust recommendation system that delivers personalized product suggestions, enhancing customer experience and potentially increasing sales conversion rates.
